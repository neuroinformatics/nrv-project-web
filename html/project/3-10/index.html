The goal of this study is to clarify the mechanisms of the integration 
of network activity in the primary visual cortex (V1).  There is considerable 
evidence that the neuronal response to stimulation of the classical receptive 
field (CRF) is modulated by the stimulus presented outside of CRF.  This 
modulation is generally suppressive and is dependent on the relationship 
among the parameters of stimuli inside and outside the CRF.  This 
"stimulus-context-dependent response modulation" is supposed to have a 
functional significance in controlling the optimal cortical output, according 
to the distribution and intensity of input over the large-scale network in V1.
</p>
<p>
To assess the possible mechanisms underlying the modulation, we examined 
the effects of pharmacological blockade of intracortical inhibition as well as 
the effects of controlling neuronal excitation level on the response 
modulation by changing stimulus contrast.  Microiontophoretic 
administration of bicuculline, a GABAa receptor antagonist, did not abolish 
the suppressive modulation, suggesting that the intracortical inhibition does 
not play a major role in it.  Also, single V1 neurons exhibited similar 
response modulation regardless of their excitation levels, suggesting that 
there is a mechanism for scaling the magnitude of modulation based on the 
level of input to a large-scale network in V1.
