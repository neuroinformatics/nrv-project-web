Ultra small Si wire probe array fabricated by VLS (Vapor-Liquid-Solid)
growth on nMOS signal processing circuit has been proposed. This wire
probe array can be formed on Si (111) wafers, and be used as
electrodes of intelligent nerve potential sensor. Figure 1 shows the
image of intelligent nerve potential sensor including Si wire probes
and signal processing circuit.

The Si wire probe with 160 mm in length and 3.5 mm in diameter at tip
grown by the selective VLS growth for growth time of 2 hours at 700 
°ÎC as shown in Fig.2. The growth rate of 1 mm/min was obtained under
increased Si gas conditions. The Si wire probe was fabricated on
circuits after IC process as shown in Fig.3. IC circuits were coated
with passivation films to protect circuit from the corrosive
environment shown. Conductive of Si wire probes can be controlled
using phosphorous diffusion, and resistivity of 10-2 W°ﬂcm was
obtained at 1100 °ÎC diffusion. The value is low enough to use the Si
wire probe for measurement of retina cell potentials. The conductive
Si wire probes are encapsulated with insulating film expect the wire
probe tips.
