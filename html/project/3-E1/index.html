Human visual system can recognize shape and texture of a 3D object
which is moving as well as deforming in a complex environment, and
even what is meant by such dynamic characteristics of the 3D object:
its motion and deformation. The goal of our research group is to
understand and model such a high level process in visual perception of
non-rigid 3D objects. As an example, we mainly focus on the perception
of human facial expressions.  Face dynamically deforms its shape
depending on the expressions and then induces changes in visual
information that we get through our eyes. We human process such
information and recognize the expressions: anger, sad, happy, etc.
This is a mapping from the physical characteristics of the object to
the psychological descriptions of expressions.  Building a
computational model of such mapping is worth challenging and may
contribute to neuro-physiological studies of high level vision.

To solve this problem, two related studies have to be combined:
computer vision and psychology.  Computer vision techniques are used
to extract 3D physical features in the image sequence.  Optical flows
and geometrical relationships are good cues to know dynamically
deforming shape of the faces.  On the other hand, psychological
experiments are conducted to collect data of how humans perceive
facial expressions from faces of different race and identity under
various viewing conditions such as orientations.  We emphasize to make
a "bridge" between these two: the physical information and
the perceptual information.
