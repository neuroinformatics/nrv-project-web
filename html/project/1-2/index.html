A neuron receives incoming signals, changes its states and generates
output signals through biochemical and biophysical interactions within
it. The final goal of our study is to construct models of complicated
biochemical and biophysical interactions within a neuron in a computer
and thereby leading to the understanding of a neuron. At present we
focused our effort on the construction of models for synaptic
plasticity. The model is composed of reactions including activation of
calcineurin (CaN), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
(CaMKII) as shown in Fig.1. From simulations we found that at low or
high stimulation frequencies the concentration of activated CaN
([CaN*]) was higher or lower than that of activated CaMKII ([CaMKII*])
suggesting the induction of long-term potentiation (LTD) or depression
(LTP), respectively. These results were consistent with experimental
observations.  Interestingly, however, at very high stimulation
frequencies [CaMKII*] was lower than [CaN*] again suggesting the
induction of LTD, which was not reported before. Thus the model
predicted that at very high stimulation frequencies, the synaptic
efficacy is depressed instead of potentiated. This prediction has been
confirmed by experiments.

For the purpose of constructing complicated biochemical and
biophysical interactions, we developed a tool called A-Cell. One of
powerful features of A-Cell is a capability of constructing models
graphically as shown in Fig.2. A-Cell is free software. Using A-Cell
we will reach the goal of constructing comprehensive models of a
neuron in a computer.
