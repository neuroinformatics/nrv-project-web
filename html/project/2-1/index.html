The vertebrate retina consists of three layers of cells. The first
layer contains rods and cones in which the incident light is converted
into a neural activity. The last layer is made of ganglion cells, the
axon of which makes the optic nerve that carries the retinal output to
the brain. Bipolar cells, located in the middle layer, connect
photoreceptors and ganglion cells. Two types of neurons in the middle
layer, horizontal and amacrine cells, provide lateral signal pathways,
which are thought to mediate lateral inhibition between the
neighboring radial pathways consisting of photoreceptor ? bipolar cell
? ganglion cell. In the past decades, signal flow in the radial
pathways has been relatively well understood. Nevertheless, the
properties and functional role of lateral pathways, particularly those
of amacrine cells remain open.  We recently studied amacrine cells in
culture. They are identified by an amacrine cell-specific antibody
(HPC-1/Syntaxin) and by an anti-GABA antibody (Fig. 1). To examine the
generation and propagation of action potentials in the dendrites, we
applied two patch clamp pipettes on the same cell, one on the soma and
another on the dendrite. By using "the action potential clamp method",
we have demonstrated that the action potential generated in the soma
can propagate to the dendrite, and the propagation is mediated by the
TTX-sensitive, voltage-dependent Na+ current. Furthermore, the
amplitude and propagation of the dendritic action potential is
modulated by locally applied GABA. These results suggest that the
signal in amacrine cells is processed locally in dendrites, not as a
whole in the soma.

Morphology of rat amacrine cells cultured for
10 days. A-C: Immunohistological identification of amacrine cells. A:
Bright field image of cultured amacrine cells. Large multipolar cells
(a and b) and small cells (c and d) are seen. B: Cells a and b were
immunoreactive to HPC-1/Syntaxin antibody (red). Cells c and d were
negative. C: Cells a and b were also immunopositive for GABA (green),
while cells c and d were negative. Scale bar = 10 um. D-E: An amacrine
cell recorded by the patch clamp technique in the whole cell
configuration with a pipette containing 0.1 % Lucifer yellow. D:
Photomicrography taken by the Nomarski optics. The diameter of the
dendritic field was approximately 250 um. Scale bar = 50 um. E: The
same cell as D observed under the fluorescent microscopy.
