<p>
In order to reveal the characteristics of biological neural
systems, a suitable simulation and analysis environment is
very important. The basic concept of system analysis is in
the form of the cycle: data analysis, modeling, computer
simulation, evaluation and experimental testing.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this study is to develop "Neuroinformatics
Desktop Environment" (NI-DTE) which is a computer support
desktop environment package for neuroinformatics.
</p>
<p>
First and second year, we have developed a software named
``Neuroinformatics SATELLITE'' (NI-SATELLITE).
It is brush up version of the system analysis total
environment "<A

SATELLITE</A>" (developed by <A

physiological engineering laboratory, TUT</A>.)
