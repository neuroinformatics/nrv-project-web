The visual cortex contains regular arrangements of neurons
corresponding to specific types of visual stimulation, such as ocular
dominance, orientation, and direction. These cortical structures can
be considered to constitute the functional architecture for early
visual information processing (Fig. 1). Recently, ocular dominance and
orientation maps were observed in cat primary visual cortex of a cat
raised without visual experiences. These experimental results suggest
that organized visual input is not necessary for formation of cortical
maps. On the other hand, it has been found that map formation is
affected by extraordinary visual experiences during critical
period. For example, in monocularly deprived animals, it is well known
that the number of cells that respond to visual inputs to the deprived
eye decreases compared with a normally reared animal and that the
width of deprived eye domains become narrow. With respect to
orientation maps, there is still some controversy as to whether or not
the number of cells that have selectivity to the presented orientation
increases, when the animal is presented an oriented contour as it is
reared.

We proposed a mathematical model for self-organization of neural
networks based on Hebbian learning rule, and show that cortical
receptive fields and their related columns (ocular dominance,
orientation and direction map) were formed simply following exposure
to unorganized light inputs.  In this project, we attempt to construct
an activity-dependent self-organization model by incorporating recent
experimental results from neurophysiology and anatomy, aiming at
understanding the role of visual experience in the functional map
formation. Now, we conducted computer simulations for two conditions:
(1) activities of LGN cells were evoked only by unorganized random
visual input to the retina (Fig. 2a); and (2) LGN neurons were
activated by the presentation of moving grating patterns in various
directions of motion (Fig. 2b). The results suggest that visual
experience can promote the maturation of orientation maps.
