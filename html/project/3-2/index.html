It is accepted that visual perception is achieved by grouping and
segmentation of a particular visual object from complex patterns
presented in the retina (Fig. 1a). Recent findings from
electro-physiological studies suggest that synchronous spike
activities among different visual cortical neurons are involved in the
grouping and segmentation processes for visual perception. The
functional role of correlated activities of cortical neurons draw
special attention. So far we have successfully demonstrated
qualitatively a mechanism of tilt illusion (e.g., Fig. b), using a
large-scale network composed of simple neuron units in the rate-coding
scheme. However, the neuron units in the rate-coding scheme are no
longer satisfactory to understand a relationship between spike-based
correlated activities and visual perception. We need to build a
network model composed of more realistic neuron units that elicit
spike activities in response to spatiotemporal visual patterns
presented in the model retina. In this project, we attempt to
construct such a network model of the visual cortex by integrating
many lines of evidence obtained from psychophysics, neurophysiology,
anatomy etc. towards the understanding of a holistic mechanism of
visual perception.

Now we are building a large scale neural network model composed of
integrate-and fire units taking into account intracortical connections
as well as afferent inputs from the LGN (Fig. 2) to seek for neural
correlates of feature binding and segmentation. In this model,
geniculo-cortical inputs are obtained by our self-organization model,
and intracortical connections are assumed to be short-range excitatory
and long-range-inhibitory isotropic connections. From the computer
simulation based on this model, we found that orientation and
direction selectivity is enhanced by the intracortical connections
though the selectivity emerges from the pattern of afferent inputs
(Fig. 3).
