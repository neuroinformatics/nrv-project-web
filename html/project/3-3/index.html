The goal of this study is to understand functional role of color vision:
coding, representation and interpretation of color information by the 
visual pathway. To this end, a computational models are 
developed to explain various phenomena relating to color perception, 
including color transparency, constancy, categorical color 
perception and visual attention to color. 
</p>
<p>
Since the NRV project has started, color transparency have been
studied as one of the target phenomena of the computational theory. 
Perception of transparency refers to the phenomenon that an observer 
sees not only surfaces behind a transparent medium but also the 
transparent medium itself. The proposed theory successfully
decompose a given color image into multiple layers by determining 
the depth ordering of surfaces and the type of color mixture, 
according to the physical realizability of recovered surface
properties.
</p>
<p>
The heart of computational theory/modeling of color perception 
is shedding light on a problem how color information is 
represented in the visual pathway. Several types of experiments 
provide evidence that imply the existence of higher-order color 
mechanisms which visual cortex is thought to be a more likely 
substrate for. Psychophysical experiments are now being 
planed to explore the color representation mediating color detection 
or discrimination or color segregation. Experimental results should 
provide hints for mathematical description of the color 
representation in the computational model of color perception.
