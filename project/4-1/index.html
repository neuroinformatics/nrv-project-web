   The purpose of this study is the development of vision chips 
which perform early visual processing for motion detection in a retina
of vertebrates and a brain of low-level animals.  This study leads 
also to the development of fundamental technologies
for analog devices and circuits and massively parallel,
fault-tolerant and low-power networks.

<p>
   Straight motion in a three-dimensional space can be detected based 
on the model of locusts.   A network for the model was constructed 
with arrays of the fundamental circuits for edge detection, 
one-dimensional motion detection and range detection.   The results 
of SPICE simulation showed that the output was steeply increased 
as a target approached the chip.   The approaching direction and 
velocity were detected as well.
</p>
<p>
   A network for motion detection in a three-dimensional space 
should be developed based on a network for motion detection 
in a two-dimensional space.   Finally, a simple-shape recognition 
will be combined to the motion detection.   Then the motion is 
represented with the optical flow constructed by mapping 
the motion vector of each receptive field.
