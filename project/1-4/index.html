The goal of this study is to produce models of small neural networks
which can reproduce behavior of cultured neural networks by
integrating knowledge obtained from them. To this aim, neurons are
cultured on substrates with multi-electrode arrays which make it
possible to obtain electrical activity from a large number of neurons
in the network simultaneously.

It is very useful to form simplified neural networks using cultured
neurons and study on their electrical characteristics, in order to
produce model neural networks, " virtual neural networks", which can
reproduce behavior of the realistic ones. For this purpose, neurons
from pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis are going to be cultured on
substrates with multi-electrode arrays and with patterns of cell
adhesive materials which can form simplified networks. In order to
study the differences of electrical activity pattern between cultured
neural networks and real neuronal networks, the activity of neurons in
central ring ganglia which include central pattern generator were
observed using a needle type multi-electrode array. Periodic
oscillation was observed as shown in the figure. It should be of great
interest to reproduce such oscillation using simplified cultured
neuronal networks in order to produce models of small networks.
