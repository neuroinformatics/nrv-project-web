We developed analog-digital hybrid CMOS circuits producing optical
flows of visual images, aiming at the development of high-speed and
compact motion processing systems. The circuit computes the optical
flows in real time by parallel operations of a number of local motion
processors on the basis of the mechanisms of biological motion
detectors.

Three kinds of CMOS circuits that are useful for constructing
motion-detection neurochips were developed, i.e., i) current-mode
quantizers for image quantization, ii) current-mode XOR circuits for
binary edge detection, and iii) analog circuits for motion
detection. Figure 1 shows sample structure of the motion-detection
chip consisting of the above circuits.

The analog motion-detection circuit, which implements the unit cell of
correlation neural networks, produces direction selective voltages for
moving current spots between two adjacent input terminals
(Fig. 2). The circuit consists of i) a delay circuit that produces
delayed voltage from the input current (P1) and ii) a correlation
circuit that multiplies the delayed voltage and the input current
(P2). We fabricated prototype chips consisting of above basic
circuits. Figure 2 shows example operations of the motion detection
circuit. The output of the circuit was 0 V when the current spot moved
from the terminals of P2 to that of P1, while it outputted nonzero
voltage when the spot moved opposite direction, as expected. Thus, the
circuit produces direction-selective responses for moving
objects. These circuits can be used to construct analog-digital hybrid
neuromorphic chips.
