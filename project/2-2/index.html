In the visual system, nearby neurons of similar functional type have a
tendency to fire synchronously.  Cross-correlation analysis of spike
discharges recorded from pairs of neurons has revealed that the
synchronized activity is frequently associated with oscillatory firing
patterns.  However, the underlying neural mechanisms and functions of
synchronous oscillations are not well understood.  The aim of our
research is to analyze the mechanisms responsible for the synchronized
oscillatory activities in the retina and to construct a mathematical
model.  Using the flat-mount as well as slice preparations we will
record light-evoked responses from various retinal neurons to
determine whether oscillations emerge from a pacemaker cell or a
neuronal circuit, and how responses are synchronized.  The
physiological and morphological data will be incorporated into the
model.
