To understand how visual system works in our brain, we need to
understand the properties of neurons, the functional building blocks
of the nervous systems.  Traditionally, neurons have been regarded as
threshold elements with passive properties that linearly summate
incoming inputs and send out impulses when a threshold is
reached. Recent findings, however, revealed far more complicated and
dynamic properties of neurons. It has been shown, for example, that
diversity of voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels are distributed
along the dendrites of neurons and that the neurons show quite
complicated activities such as non-linear summation of EPSPs, firing
of actions potentials in the dendrites, sub-threshold membrane
oscillations and synaptic plasticity. The traditional view of neurons
no longer help us understand the way brain works. Novel view needs to
be established.

Our goal in this project is to understand the way neurons integrate
information, to establish model neurons and to describe the behavior
of neurons as simulators. To achieve this goal we investigate synaptic
responses of hippocampal pyramidal neurons using fast-optical imaging
techniques so that we can simultaneously detect synaptic responses
from various locations of neurons, and reproduce the behavior of
neurons using multi-compartmental model neuron simulators. Results of
our study should provide the basis to analyze how visual information
is processed in visual pathways.
