The Goal of this study is to understand how intracellular signaling
molecules are integrated to produce proper cell responses to external
stimuli. We particularly focus on the molecular signaling in an
adaptive morphological response to mechanical stimuli, in other words,
how the spatial pattern of mechanical stimuli are transformed into
cell shape.  To this end, we conduct both experimental and theoretical
approaches, the former would provide us information on what types of
molecules and signaling networks are involved, and the latter how the
networks are regulated and integrated.

Cells seem to recognize spatiotemporal pattern of external
stimuli. For example endothelial cells subjected to uniaxial cyclic
stretch remodel their shape from irregular one to spindle like one
with aligning their longitude perpendicular to the stretch axis
(Fig.1). When subjected to a sustained uniaxial stretch the cells
align their longitude parallel to the axis. The first question is how
mechano-receptors on the cell membrane detect and transduce
spatiotemporal pattern of mechanical stimuli, and second how the
transduced signals are transformed into their shape. Our first goal is
to identify mechano-receptors and their downstream signaling
networks. So far we could identify two putative mechano-receptors, a
stretch activated (SA) ion channel and the integrin (an adhesion
molecule). Mechanical information transduced by these receptors may be
integrated at the focal adhesion and some structural changes would be
initiated.  Recently we found that actin fibers (orange colored strand
like structures in Fig.2) originated from the focal adhesion (green
colored spots) change their orientation from random one to aligned one
perpendicular to the stretch axis. We are now investigating how actin
fibers can convert the orientation of mechanical stimuli into their
orientation.  Based on expected results we will construct a molecular
network model to explain the remodeling process. The unique aspect of
this study is that it will provide a model how intracellular chemical
reactions are spatially regulated, which is essentially important to
understand the mechanisms of cell migration and synaptogenesis in the
brain.
