Goal of this study is to understand the functional mechanisms for
sensory signal processing and behavioral control in a small brain of
honeybee. Many investigations on honeybee behavior and neural
mechanisms have been done during this century. Mathematical models for
cellular, neural network and behavioral mechanisms will be presented
in this study. These models will be implemented on the simulation
server and can be accessed through the web browser.

<p>
We are constructing models of honeybee in harmony with bottom-up
(cellar to network) and top-down (behavior to network) approaches.

<ol>
  <li> behavioral changes of conditioning by using associated visual or
  olfactory stimulus would be a suitable paradigm to investigate the
  neural mechanisms for acquisition of sensory signals and controlling
  honeybee behavior. in recent years, ionic current properties of
  neurons in the insect brain have been measured by the patch-clamp
  technique on an isolated cell. on the other hand, spatio-temporal
  properties of neural network responses have also been shown by the
  optical recording and multi-channel recording methods. in order to
  reveal the mechanisms and functions of neuron and neural network of
  honeybee, we are integrating results and knowledge from these
  experiments, and building a mathematical model.

  <li>In the hive, honeybee's behavior is changed by her age and and other
  sensory inputs. Worker, queen and drone's behaviors in the hive have
  been observed and recorded by single-individual trailing (SIT)
  method. Behavioral patterns of honeybee are categorized in about 150
  based on the position and movement of body parts. We describe the
  behavioral sequence in SIT data as a mathematical model. It is
  expected to get the neural network model for generating honeybee
  behavior, because behavior would be reflecting the changing of
  activity in the nervous system.
