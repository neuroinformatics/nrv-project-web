The goal of this study is to understand the mechanism of visual
pattern recognition in the brain.  We use modeling approach.  In other
words, we study how to interconnect neurons to synthesize a network
with the same functions and abilities as the brain.  When synthesizing
a model, we try to follow physiological and psychological evidence as
faithfully as possible.  For parts that are not yet clear, we
construct a hypothesis and synthesize a model that follows the
hypothesis.  We then analyze or simulate the behavior of the model,
and compare it with that of the brain.  If we find any discrepancy in
behavior of the model and the brain, we change the initial hypothesis
and modify the model.  We repeat this procedure until the model
behaves in the same way as the brain.

We especially concentrate upon the mechanism of character and object
recognition, where the interaction of bottom-up and top-down signals
in hierarchical neural networks plays an important role.

Fig. 2 shows an example of the problem we are now tackling.  Partly
occluded patterns shown in (a), in which the occluding objects are
invisible, are almost illegible, but the patterns in (b), in which the
occluding objects are visible, are much easier to read.  A neural
network model that responds to these stimuli like a human being is an
example of the models we are trying to construct.
