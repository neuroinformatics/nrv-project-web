The final goal of this study is to develop a database system for
neuronal visual system (Visiome Platform). The Visiome Platform
integrates mathematical models of various levels from molecules to
networks with experimental data, references, related books and links
to other internet resources. It will provide more than just a database
of models, data and research tools. The Visiome Platform will realize
a virtual environment for global collaborations by making available to
researchers useful tools for simulation, analyzing experimental data,
and facilitating hypothesis formulation.

To achieve this, the Visiome Platform has two major characteristic
features. First, it will allow researchers to reuse the models and
experimental data in the database. Researchers can see how the models
work or compare their own results with other experimental data,
improve or integrate models, and formulate their own hypothesis into a
model. Second, it will provide novel indexes of research field in the
visual system specially oriented to the model studies.  The system's
indexes will be based on neuronal and cognitive functions in the
visual system that are important targets of model studies. The
model-oriented indexes will help researchers to understand the visual
system from the aspect of visual functions and to construct models
formulating their own hypotheses. The Visiome Platform is expected to
be a powerful tool for neuroscience researchers facilitating their
research activities by providing an integrated environment for
mathematical modeling.
