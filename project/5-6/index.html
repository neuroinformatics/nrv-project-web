The goal of our study is to develop an integrative support environment
for Mathematical analysis and computer simulation study in
neuroinformatics research, which is a basic platform for researchers
engaged in neuroinformatics in vision project and else.
</p>

<p>
Last year, we have been ported the SATELLITE in MS-Windows. And we
confirmed that it can run with the UNIX environment by a little
modification. It is because this code was made not to depend on the
platforms.
</p>

<p>
This year, in order to develop a function of real-time simulation on
the SATELLITE we first construct the fundametal systems such as code
generation, parameter trunning, monitoring, data loging.
Next we integrate them in the SATELLITE environment.
The fusion of a mathematical model made by SATELLITE and the
physiological system will make us utilize model based simulation study.
